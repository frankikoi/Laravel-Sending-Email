Hello Ma'am/Sir,

I trust this message finds you well. I am pleased to submit my output for the test project. I utilized PHP as the programming language, and the Laravel framework to build the application. For styling, I incorporated external CSS to enhance the visual appeal of the page.

Attached herewith, you will find the database file and a demonstration of the email-sending functionality initiated through the user inputs. If necessary, I am more than willing to provide a live presentation to showcase the operation of the email-sending feature.

I appreciate the opportunity to work on this project and sincerely hope that I have successfully fulfilled the specified requirements.

Thank you for considering my submission.

Note:
In importing the database, the database name should be db_contact_us

Best regards,
Azel
